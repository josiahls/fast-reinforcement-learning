- [X] 0.7.0 Full test suite using multi-processing. Connect to CI.
- [X] 0.8.0 Comprehensive model eval **debug/verify**. Each model should succeed at at least a few known environments. Also, massive refactoring will be needed.
- [X] 0.9.0 Notebook demonstrations of basic model usage.
- [X] **1.0.0** Base version is completed with working model visualizations proving performance / expected failure. At 
this point, all models should have guaranteed environments they should succeed in.
